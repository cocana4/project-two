            <button class="accordion">Q: How many people are homeless?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>On a given night in 2019, 567,715 people experienced homelessness 
                  in the U.S.  Between October 1, 2016, and September 30, 2017, an 
                  estimated 950,497 people used an emergency shelter or transitional 
                  housing program..</p>
                  <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of
                     Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
                     consider a person to be homeless if they are sleeping outside, in a 
                     place not meant for human habitation such as a car or abandoned building, or in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program. Other federal agencies have different definitions for homelessness.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Q: Who is most affected by homelessness?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Numerical size is one reason to focus on a subpopulation within 
                  homelessness.  Risk is another.  Some groups are much more likely 
                  to become homeless than the national average. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pacific Islanders and Native Americans are most likely to be 
                  homeless in America when compared to all other racial/ethnic groups. 
                   Within the former, 160 people experience homelessness out of every 
                   10,000 compared to the national average of 17 out of every 10,000.  
                  Pacific Islanders and Native Americans are numerically small groups 
                  within the U.S., making it more difficult for the U.S. Census Bureau 
                  and homelessness services systems to count them accurately.  
                  Nevertheless, available data suggest they face significant challenges.
                </p>
                <p>Black Americans, multiracial Americans, and Hispanics/Latinxs are 
                  similarly situated. Group members are far more likely to be homeless
                  than the national average and white Americans.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Q: What causes homelessness?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>The nation is currently facing one of the most severe affordable 
                  housing crises in history. Not surprisingly, those living in poverty 
                  are the most significantly affected.</p>
                  <p>Other reasons can include disability, chronic health conditions, 
                  domestic violence and systemic inequality. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Overall, a lack of accessible infrastructure has led to an 
                    abundance of homeless citizens within the United States for a 
                    variety of reasons. </p>

            <button class="accordion">Q: What are some of the bariers to ending homelessness?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Funding for agencies addressing homelessness has been hovering around 
                  a billion dollars for over a decade, despite a dramatic increase in 
                  homelessness during that time. About 75% of emergency shelters rely 
                  in part or whole on government funding, and cuts at the federal level
                   hurt the ability of local agencies to meet increasing need.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The number of "working poor" families needing shelter services has 
                  increased: a full one-quarter of the families in emergency shelter 
                  earn too much to qualify for public assistance. At the same time, 
                  revenue for emergency shelter for families from public sources has 
                  decreased every year since 1991. As a result, the number of "slots" 
                  for families has decreased as have the resources and services available 
                  to families.

            <button class="accordion">Q: What are the impacts of the pandemic?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Because many people who are homeless are older adults or have underlying 
                  medical conditions they may also be at increased risk for severe illness 
                  than the general population. Health departments and healthcare facilities 
                  should be aware that people who are homeless are a particularly vulnerable 
                  group.</p>
